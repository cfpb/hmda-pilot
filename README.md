4. Add any libraries, assets, or hard dependencies whose source code will be included
   in the project's repository to the _Exceptions_ section in the [TERMS](TERMS.md).
  - If no exceptions are needed, remove that section from TERMS.

# Project Title

**Description**:  Put a meaningful, short, plain-language description of what
this project is trying to accomplish and why it matters.

Other things to include:

  - **Status**:  Alpha, Beta, 1.1, etc. It's OK to write a sentence, too. The goal is to let interested people know where this project is at. This is also a good place to link to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
  - **Links to production or demo instances**
  - Describe what sets this apart from related-projects. Linking to another doc or page is OK if this can't be expressed in a sentence or two.


**Screenshot**: If the software has visual components, place a screenshot after the description; e.g.,

## How to get this running or how to use it

Detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and get the project running.
This should be frequently tested to ensure reliability. Alternatively, a link to
another page is fine, but it's important that this works.


## Getting involved

This section should detail why people should get involved and describe key areas you are
currently focusing on; e.g., trying to get feedback on features, fixing certain bugs, building
important pieces, etc.

General instructions on _how_ to contribute should be stated with a link to [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
